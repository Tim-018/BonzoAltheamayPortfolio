        <div class="card">
        <p style="color:black;"> Hi, I am <b>Altheamay Timothy Bonzo</b>.I am currently studying in the University of the Cordilleras. 
        I'm in my 1st year taking the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, majoring in web technology. Before I graduate 
        from senior high school, I have already decided to get this course because it's very in demand now a days, and I really 
        love how technology developed year by year. I am trying my best to be successful and make my parents proud. </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:black; "> I know that nothing is easy in this world so I really expected that I needed more
        effort to learn programming. My one and only goal is to use my knowledge to developt the technology in our
        country. I have a lot of dreams and nothing can stop me to achieve it. A little tip to achieve our dreams, 
        have faith to God and have inspirations in life. </p>

                <p style="color:black;">I'll share somethings that I learned dor the past months being a student in the University of the Cordilleras.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="color:black;">CC1 </h3>
                <div class="card">
                <p style="color: black;">CC1 provided a comprehensive overview of <b>computer fundamentals, covering topics such as binary numbers, hardware components, and basic 
                    programming concepts</b>. This course really amazed me more because I can easily understand the lessons and easily apply what is being thought to us.
                    <br>
                    Our professor that time is very kind and helpful. What I learned are the <b>number systems</b> provide various ways to represent numbers, while operations on 
                    them involve manipulating these representations, crucial in fields like computing and mathematics. And <b>HTML</b> is essential for anyone interested in web 
                    development, as it serves as the foundation for <b>building web pages</b> and is often combined with other technologies like <b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
                    and JavaScript</b> to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. So I used it by making my own online portfolio. Then about <b>informations</b>, the 
                    context of communication, information is a representation of data that conveys meaning, reducing uncertainty by transmitting from the sender to the receiver."</p>
                    <br>
                </div>
                <h3 style="color:black;">CC2 </h3>
                <div class="card">
                <p style="color:black;"> CC2 introduced me to the world of programming through <b>Python</b>, a <i>versatile and beginner-friendly language</i>. Throughout the course, I gained 
                    proficiency in writing simple programs, learning essential concepts such as variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions. This foundation in Python 
                    programming has empowered me to tackle various computational tasks and problem-solving challenges.
                    <br>
                    This course is very tough to m eat first because its first the first time that I got leanred about programming. And it's the 
                    very first language I learned beside html, it's the Python language. At first It's very tough but after learning futher, it amazed me and it's exciting
                    while doing it. Our professor is very helpful too because she guidied us and give tips for doing the program, which is their are <b>inputs, outputs, and 
                    decision control structures</b>. And the very difficult thing are the loop, which is the <b>repetition control structures</b>. It's a difficult months but 
                    I managed by the help of my professor, classmates who are advanced than me and youtube. </p>

                    in writing basic programs in C#, learning about variables, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming principles.
                    <br>
                    This course is one of the difficut course for me. It's very different to cc2 but this is another language that I should learn but honestly I just learned the basic
                    syntax, variable or data types. </p>
                </div>
                <h3 style="color:black;">CC4 </h3>
                <div class="card">

                    I gained knowledge of basic algorithms for finding, sorting, and traversing a variety of fundamental data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, 
                    during the course. With this knowledge, I can now approach problems with methodical approaches and maximize the efficiency of computational activities but need to learn more.
                    <br>
                    This course is also one of the difficult course. It is also another language called <b>Java</b>. Our professor is good at teaching but it's just I can't handle how hard is the 
                    course are. The good thing is that I had a blockmate that very helpful and kind, he helps us sometimes if we are having a hard time understanding the instructions that our professor
                    said. </p>
                </div>
